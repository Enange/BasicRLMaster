# BasicRL
A basic implementation of the standard reinforcement learning algorithms in Pytorch, designed to work with gym-like environments.
All others algorithms in Tensorflow, basicRl and Myplotter are written by **Davide Corsi**

## Available Algorithms in Pytorch

- [x] Deep Q-Learning (DDQN)
- [ ] REINFORCE

## Available Algorithms in TensorFlow
- [x] REINFORCE
- [x] Actor-Critic
- [x] Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)
- [x] Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- [x] Montecarlo Proximal Policy Optimization (mcPPO)
- [x] Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQN)
- [x] Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- [ ] Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) 
- [x] Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)
